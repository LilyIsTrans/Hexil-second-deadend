## Abandoned as a dead-end

I didn't work on this project for a while, in the meantime became a better programmer, and now consider all of this code unsalvageably bad, so I am archiving the repo for posterity and starting fresh once again. Maybe the third time will be the charm! This next go around I actually have a deadline for a prototype, so that'll probably help.

# Hexil

A pixel art studio with non-square pixel support. 

Named after it's ability to use hexagons as pixels.

## THIS IS NOT OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE

At the moment, this is *not* open source software. It's source code is freely viewable on GitHub, obviously,
you're presumably reading it there, but as of right now I haven't decided if I want to actually open-source it,
nor if so under what license. I choose to leave the source viewable for a variety of reasons, but I do *not*
grant permission to do anything with it other than look at it.
